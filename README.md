## BankNote Mining?

### Our team at BankNote noticed a few major flaws about new & established cryptocurrencies:

- A vast majority of new coins are premined meaning the Coin's creator/team own an overwhelming amount of the coins total supply. In other words, their value can be manipulated in an unfair way.

- There are no options to mine certain new cryptocurrencies, or their coins do not function based off of miner's work. You can not mine these coins, so the only ways of obtaining it are through purchasing it or crypto exchanges.

- Most established cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have already gone through a number of halving processes. This leads to an extremely low reward of coins per block mined on their blockchain. Additionally, the mining difficulty for these established coins is too intense for most common computers.

- Mining can come off as a difficult process to get started with cryptocurrencies. Issues can range from difficult or confusing software interfaces to computer incompatibility.

### BankNote Solves these Issues with the following Features:

- BankNote is Mining based, so our team of Creators do not own an overwhelming or unfair supply of BankNote. We own what we mine, exactly the same as anyone else in the community!

- Mined BankNote Blocks currently reward a HIGH amount of 75 BankNote Coins! This is not by mistake; BankNote is set to highly incentivize it's miners for their crucial part in BankNote's Blockchain. We realize and appreciate the role miners play in keeping transactions flowing quickly and efficiently.

- BankNote is in its early stages, so the mining difficulty is at its easiest! We want everyone to be able to experience BankNote Mining without having to own the latest or greatest Graphics Card.

- Our Mining Software is compatibile with ANY Windows or Linux Machine and takes a single click to start, run, and maintain itself!
